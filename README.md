# React Parent-Child Communication Example

This is a basic React app showing how data can be passed between a parent and a child component.

## Features

- The **Parent** component displays a message and updates based on data from the **Child** component.
- The **Child** component sends data to the parent using a function passed as a prop.

## How It Works

1. The parent manages a state (`childName`).
2. The child component calls a function from the parent to update `childName`.
3. The parent displays the updated `childName` value.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

## Technologies Used

- React
- CSS
